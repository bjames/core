At it's core, your blog is the content that you write. 

core is a simple, markdown based blogging platform that allows you to really own your blog. core renders flat markdown files into html and serves them to your users. Should you ever decide to switch blogging platforms, you don't need to worry about exporting your content from a database or using a tool to handle the conversion for you.
