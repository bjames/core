Core is still in it's infancy so it's very much a work in progress. This roadmap notes any planned changes to the application and also notes any unresolved issues.

# Weird Things
- Favicon Generation currently depends on the user going to [favicon-generator.org](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- Server needs to be restarted to pick up new or changed markdown files
- The order of notes modified on the same date is random

# v0.2.0 Planned Features
- Render new and modified markdown without a reboot
- Better night/day mode image handling
- Minimize JS and CSS at server start
- Logo and config files should be loaded from the raw folder

# v0.3.0 Planned Features
- Additional built in CSS options

# The road to v1.0.0
- Admin Panel
- Additional Markdown Upload options
