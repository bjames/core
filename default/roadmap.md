# Weird Things
- Favicon Generation currently depends on the user going to [favicon-generator.org](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- No JS or CSS minimization takes place at run time
- Server needs to be restarted to pick up new or changed markdown files
- The order of notes modified on the same date is random
